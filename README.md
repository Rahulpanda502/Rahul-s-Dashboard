# Rahul-s-Dashboard
📢 Excited to share that I’ve completed my Power BI Certification from Udemy!

In this course, I learned how to:
✅ Create professional business reports from scratch
✅ Clean and combine raw data into interactive dashboards and visuals
✅ Use the same tools used by data analysts and data scientists
✅ Work with AI tools for advanced data analysis and visualization
✅ Complete full-scale projects with real-world use cases

As part of the course, I followed step-by-step methods to build my own dashboard using the data provided, and I’m currently working on another similar project.

Today, data-driven decision-making is more important than ever, and knowing tools like Power BI is a key skill for this.
