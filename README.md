ðŸ“¢ Excited to share that Iâ€™ve completed my Power BI Certification from Udemy!

In this course, I learned how to:
âœ… Create professional business reports from scratch
âœ… Clean and combine raw data into interactive dashboards and visuals
âœ… Use the same tools used by data analysts and data scientists
âœ… Work with AI tools for advanced data analysis and visualization
âœ… Complete full-scale projects with real-world use cases

As part of the course, I followed step-by-step methods to build my own dashboard using the data provided, and Iâ€™m currently working on another similar project.

Today, data-driven decision-making is more important than ever, and knowing tools like Power BI is a key skill for this.
